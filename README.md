# About this repo
Updated code samples from the Microsoft Press book "[Programming Microsoft Azure Service Fabric](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/programming-microsoft-azure-service-fabric-9781509301881)"
by [Haishi Bai](https://github.com/HaishiBai) for the latest version of the Azure
&amp; Service Fabric SDK's.

The book was originally released in June of 2016 and targetted Azure SDK v2.8.1 &amp;
Service Fabric SDK v2.0.135 Preview. After purchasing the book in December 2016 and
installing the latest SDK's, I found that a lot of the sample code wouldn't work as
written (LINQ expressions against the Reliable collections being one example).

After reaching out to Haishi about updated samples, I decided to create this repo to
host the updates I made after Haishi indicated that he didn't have the time to update
them personally. Updates will be made as I work through the book and after new SDK's
have been released (based on personal availability and community help).
